Starts with a base 12.04 server installation, no packages/groups added during OS installation.
It's best to install the server, then ssh in and run the script because there's a couple of steps
that'll be much easier if you can copy/paste.

Running this script as root (sudo sh <scriptname>) against a base 12.04 server install should
have you up and running without any additional fiddling around. Let me know if you see a better way
to do this, or find any glaring errors.
